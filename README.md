# sensora

Call for Code 2021: Project Sensora

Economic and social progress over the past century has been accompanied by drastic environmental degradation which is endangering the very systems on which our future development depends. To address this challenge, weâ€™ve developed a prototype sensor that sends environmental telemetry data (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) to support farmers and the overall watering system of contemporary agriculture.
