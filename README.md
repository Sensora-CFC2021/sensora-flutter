A basic GitHub repository example for new [Call for Code](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/) projects and those that join the Call for Code with The Linux Foundation deployment initiative. Not all sections or files are required. You can make this as simple or as in-depth as you need. And don't forget to [register for Call for Code 2021](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/get-started/)!

## Short description

### What's the problem?

The United Nations has established Sustainable Development Goal 12 to help ensure that the world moves towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. This goal is about systemic change, decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation, and applying a lifecycle thinking approach, taking into account all phases of resource use to do more and better with less. It is about increasing resource efficiency and promoting sustainable lifestyles. It can contribute substantially to poverty alleviation and the transition towards low-carbon and green economies. Production and green consumption of goods and services should drive economic growth and improve quality of life, but with fewer natural resources and less environmental impact across the lifecycle.

Economic and social progress over the past century has been accompanied by drastic environmental degradation that is endangering the very systems on which our future development depends

### How can technology help?

//must add technology 

### The idea

Weâ€™ve developed a prototype talking sensor to support smallholder farmers to become responsible producers. The sensor sends environmental telemetry data (temperature, humidity, and spilt moisture) to improve their watering system

## Demo video

//ADD DEMO HERE

## The architecture

![Architecture](./images/Architecture.png)

1. //EXPLAIN HERE.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.//

## Sensora project roadmap

Currently, our project:

- Shows environmental telemetry data of the field/Soil
- Shows weather data

See below for our proposed schedule on the following steps after Call For Code 2021 Submission
