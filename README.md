# Sensora

Economic and social progress over the past century has been accompanied by environmental degradation that is endangering the very systems on which our future development depends. Regarding sustainable consumption and production patterns, we have developed a prototype talking sensor to support smallholder farmers to become responsible producers. The sensor sends environmental telemetry data (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) to improve their watering system
