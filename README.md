# Sensora

Many farmers struggle with clean water depletion due to deficient water management and limited access to information. Such extensive use of water continues to have destructive impacts on the environment and is endangering the very systems on which our future depends. 

Regarding sustainable consumption and production patterns, we present “Sensora”, which can speak to the farmers directly to help prevent excess water usage, preserving the most important natural resource, and promoting a sustainable lifestyle. Sensora has sensors, a portable station, and a mobile app. The sensors are set in the soil of the field and transmit the telemetry (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) data to the station.
