# Sensora

## Short description

Economic and social progress over the past century has been accompanied by drastic environmental degradation that is endangering the very systems on which our future development depends. Regarding sustainable consumption and production patterns, weâ€™ve developed a prototype talking sensor to support smallholder farmers to become responsible producers. The sensor sends environmental telemetry data (temperature, humidity, and spilt moisture) to improve their watering system

1. //EXPLAIN HERE.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.//
